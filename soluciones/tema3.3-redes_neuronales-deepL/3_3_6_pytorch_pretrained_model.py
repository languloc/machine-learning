text = r"""Goldfinger is the seventh novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series.
First published in 1959, it centres on Bond's investigation into the
gold-smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is suspected of being
connected to Soviet counter-intelligence. Bond uncovers Goldfinger's plot
involving the gold reserves at Fort Knox (pictured). In Goldfinger, Fleming
presents the character of James Bond as a more complex individual than in the
previous novels. A theme of Bond as a St George figure is echoed by the fact
that Bond is a British Secret Service agent sorting out an American problem.
Fleming probably based the gold-obsessed character of Goldfinger on the American
gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard Jr. On its release, the novel went to the top
of the best-seller lists. It was adapted as the third James Bond feature film of
the Eon Productions series, released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond.
